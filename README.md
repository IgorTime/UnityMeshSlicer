# UnityMeshSlicer
Simple mesh slicer plugin for Unity. It's quite simple and fast, and generates small amount of garbage.

Supported features:
- only one UV channel
- only meshes with single submesh
- not copy blendposes and boneweights

Plans:
- adding multithreaded slicing algorithm using Jobs
- adding support to use more submeshes
